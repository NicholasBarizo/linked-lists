# Linked Lists Project
This project has given me the most difficulty I have had so far during this learning adventure. I didn't make the repository for days as I was stuck on getting the first function (append) to work. This function ended up being 2 lines of code. As the project continued and I got more familiary with linked lists, I found my efficiency in writing functions increase. For example, many of the functions could use the pattern of recursively calling itself by passing the next node and returning a value based on whether the next node was nil. With the help of these patterns, I ended up able to create several functions in a day as opposed to several days for a function.
